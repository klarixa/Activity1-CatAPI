# The Cat API Explorer - Activity 01 - Discovery Challenge

Welcome to your first API integration project! This template helps you learn the fundamentals of working with APIs using the fun and free The Cat API.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this activity, you will:
- Make your first API calls with JavaScript fetch()
- Understand how APIs return JSON data
- Display dynamic content from API responses
- Handle loading states and errors gracefully
- Work with different API endpoints

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ⚡ Quick Start (See Results in 30 Seconds!)

**IMPORTANT: This template now includes WORKING CODE! You can see it in action immediately:**

1. **Navigate to this folder** in your terminal/command prompt
2. **Start a local server** (choose one):
   ```bash
   # Mac/Linux:
   python3 -m http.server 8000

   # Windows:
   python -m http.server 8000

   # Alternative using Node.js:
   npx http-server -p 8000
   ```
3. **Open your browser** to: http://localhost:8000
4. **Click the buttons** - they work immediately!
   - "Get Random Cat" shows a cat image
   - "List All Breeds" displays all breeds
   - "Search Breed" lets you search (try "siamese")

### 🎯 What's Already Working

**65% of the code is implemented for you:**
- ✅ Random cat image fetching (fully working)
- ✅ Breed list display (fully working)
- ✅ Breed search (working with extension TODOs)
- ⚠️ Random breed selection (TODO for you)
- ⚠️ Raw JSON display (TODO for you)
- ⚠️ Bonus features (TODO for creativity)

### 📝 Your Learning Tasks

1. **First, test the working features** to understand the pattern
2. **Then complete the TODO sections** following the examples
3. **Finally, add your own creative extensions**

## 📋 Tasks to Complete

### TODO 1: Random Cat Function (Easy)
Complete the `getRandomCat()` function to fetch and display a random cat image.

**API Endpoint:** `https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search`

**Success Criteria:**
- Button shows loading state when clicked
- Random cat image displays with breed name (if available)
- Error handling works when API is down

### TODO 2: List All Breeds (Medium)
Complete the `getAllBreeds()` function to show all available cat breeds.

**API Endpoint:** `https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/breeds`

**Success Criteria:**
- All breed names display in a grid format
- Breed count shows in the header
- Fallback data works when API is unavailable

### TODO 3: Random Breed (Medium)
Complete the `getRandomBreed()` function to show a random breed with its image.

**Requirements:**
- First fetch all breeds, then pick one randomly
- Get an image for that specific breed
- Display both breed name and image

### TODO 4: Breed Search (Challenge)
Complete the `searchBreed()` function to search for specific breeds.

**API Endpoint:** `https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search?breed_ids={breed-id}`

**Features to implement:**
- Input validation
- Error handling for invalid breeds
- Clear input after successful search
- Helpful error messages with breed suggestions

### TODO 5: Raw JSON Display (Easy)
Complete the `showRawJson()` function to show raw API responses.

**Purpose:**
- Help students understand what APIs actually return
- Practice with JSON.stringify()
- See the full data structure

## 🛠 API Reference

### The Cat API Documentation
- **Base URL:** `https://api.thecatapi.com/v1`
- **No API key required for basic usage!** 🎉
- **CORS enabled** for browser requests
- **Rate limit:** 10 requests/second (plenty for learning)

### Key Endpoints
```javascript
// Random cat image
GET https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search

// All breeds
GET https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/breeds

// Random image of specific breed
GET https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search?breed_ids={breed_id}

// Get breed info by ID
GET https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/breeds/{breed_id}
```

### Response Format

**Random Image Response** (returns array):
```json
[{
  "id": "abc123",
  "url": "https://cdn2.thecatapi.com/images/abc123.jpg",
  "width": 1200,
  "height": 800,
  "breeds": []
}]
```

**Breeds List Response** (returns array):
```json
[{
  "id": "abys",
  "name": "Abyssinian",
  "temperament": "Active, Energetic, Independent",
  "origin": "Egypt",
  "description": "The Abyssinian is easy to care for...",
  "life_span": "14 - 15",
  "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abyssinian_(cat)"
}, ...]
```

## 🎨 Features Included

- **Error handling** with helpful messages
- **Gradient backgrounds** and modern styling

### Fallback System
- **Offline support** with sample data

- **User-friendly messages** for all scenarios

### Code Structure
- **Clear TODO sections** for student completion
- **Helper functions** already implemented
- **Detailed comments** explaining each step
- **Console logging** for debugging

## 🧪 Testing Your Work

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Random Cat button fetches and displays images
- [ ] Breed List shows all available breeds
- [ ] Random Breed picks and displays a random breed
- [ ] Search works with valid breed names (try "siamese", "persian")
- [ ] Search shows helpful errors with invalid names
- [ ] Raw JSON displays formatted API responses
- [ ] Loading states appear briefly during API calls
- [ ] All buttons work on mobile devices

### Debugging Tips
1. **Open Developer Tools** (F12 in most browsers)
2. **Check Console tab** for error messages
3. **Use Network tab** to see API requests/responses
4. **Add console.log()** statements to see data flow

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** "fetch is not a function"
**Solution:** Make sure you're testing in a browser, not Node.js

**Issue:** CORS errors
**Solution:** Use a local server (Python http.server) instead of opening HTML file directly

**Issue:** Images not loading
**Solution:** Check that the image URLs are valid in the API response

**Issue:** "Cannot read property of undefined"
**Solution:** The Cat API returns arrays - make sure to access the first element with [0]

**Need Help?**
- Check the browser console for error messages
- Review the TODO comments in script.js
- Try the working helper functions to understand the expected output
- Test one function at a time rather than all at once

Happy coding! 🐱✨
